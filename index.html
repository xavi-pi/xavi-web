        <h2>HELLO!</h2>
        <p>WHO I AM:
            <br>I'm an engineer, designer, and learner exploring ways to deal with the too-tedious or the very-complicated problems.
            <br><br>A mathematician at heart, I use creativity and numbers to find elegant solutions, understand
            complex systems, and face new problems.
            <br><br>MY ETHOS:
            <br>I have experience managing multiple, parallel projects, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and engineering complex software solutions.
            <br><br>All that research, all those projects, all that well-written code have taught me that:
            <br><br>– Research isn't only one of my skills, it's my mindset
            <br>– Work cultures that are more "agile" and less "waterfall" are just my kind
            <br>– My judgment is "mostly sound"--rifle through my jupyter notebooks
            <br>– I'm the curious one
            <br>– The combination of organization, pressure, and perspiration yields my best work. Also caffeine.
            <br><br>I learn, prototype, and learn some more.
            <br><br>WHAT I DO:
            <br>I lead innovative projects that enhance user experiences and optimize the capabilities of our software. I create and refine language artifacts, develop data pipelines and algorithms, and collaborate with cross-functional teams to advance interactions with AI technologies. By leveraging my knowledge in content creation, data analysis, and UX research, I continuously drive improvements and contribute to impactful, data-driven insights. My focus on feedback helps keep my projects competitive, while my passion for learning and problem-solving helps me stay agile in the ever-evolving world of AI and language technology.
            <br><br>I CAN HELP:
            <br>I’m available to deliver innovative software solutions, explore new ways to enhance user experiences, and optimize AI-driven content and tools.
