        <h2>HELLO!</h2>
        <p>WHO I AM:
            <br>I'm a content creator, designer, and manager exploring how people engage meaningfully with ideas.
            <br><br>A mathematician at heart, I use creativity and numbers to find elegant solutions, understand
            complex systems, and face new problems.
            <br><br>MY ETHOS:
            <br>I have experience managing multiple, parallel projects, collaborating with cross-functional teams,
            and developing web-content processes and web content.
            <br><br>All that research, all those projects, all that well-crafted content have taught me that:
            <br><br>– Research isn't only one of my skills, it's my mindset
            <br>– Work cultures that are more "agile" and less "waterfall" are just my kind
            <br>– My judgment is "mostly sound"--ask any of my former students
            <br>– I'm the curious one
            <br>– The combination of organization, pressure, and perspiration yields my best work. Also caffeine.
            <br><br>I learn, prototype, and learn some more.
            <br><br>WHAT I DO:
            <br>I manage projects to meet deadlines, follow a budget, and bring content to life.
            I produce content that's adaptable, reusable, transportable and engages people.
            I coach people on designing great content and sharing it in a way that's conversational and intuitive
            for humans and SEO-ready and well-structured for machines.
            <br><br>I CAN HELP:
            <br>I am available to manage projects, programs, or content to optimize and
            communicate ideas, effectively attracting and retaining target audiences.
